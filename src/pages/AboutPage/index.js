        <p>
          I am an enthusiastic and resourceful full-stack developer who wants to
          make the world a kinder and more compassionate place.
        </p>

        <p>
          I desire to make a positive impact on the lives and organizations I
          get to interact with through personal connection and excellent code.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the last five years, my life has been characterized by change. I
          graduated with a dual degree in Pastoral Ministry and Biblical Studies
          from Northwest University in 2015 and worked at a church until the
          beginning of 2020. During that time, I got married, adopted a dog, and
          started renting the house I grew up in.
        </p>

        <p>
          I moved on from that role at the beginning of 2020 and began working
          at SAP Concur in Bellevue as a web producer.
        </p>

        <p>
          After a short time working side by side with developers (before the
          pandemic... I work from home now), my curiosity around web development
          and coding turned from a hobby into a passion. I spent several months
          learning on my own before enrolling in the University of
          Washington&apos;s Coding Boot Camp and have since begun my journey to
          full-time web development.
        </p>

        <p>
          Through the boot camp and surrounding months, I have had undertaken a
          tremendous amount of learning. My approach has been to soak in as much
          code and development as I can bear and hold every line of code and
          project to a very high standard keeping in mind that, while learning
          is hard work, everything I learn is mine and makes subsequent learning
          easier (something I picked up from Marijn Haverbeke in Eloquent
          JavaScript).
        </p>

        <p>
          When I am not staring at a monitor for work or honing my development
          skills, I can be found walking my dog, watching one of several TV
          shows with my wife (Ted Lasso at the moment), baking bread, or far
          away in the woods with my camera.
        </p>
